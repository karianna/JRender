## JRender

This is a 3D PBR (phsical based rendering) engine completely done in java, based on raymarching.

### Clarification

This project is an **expermiment**, **do not** do/use this for "in use" purposes.

The performance is (who could have guessed) terrible, it takes many secconds to render a HQ image.

The code is online for educational purposes only


### Enjoy, learn and have fun
